// CASE: Desktop-first
// The big-desktop media query is a 'min-width' query, which means that it tests for
// screens of 1800px or more. All the other media queries are 'max-width' queries, so
// they test for screens with a size smaller then some value (tab-land: 1200px). Next
// point: the order of statements, meaning that media query statement (as all statements)
// are executed sequentialy: the top one first. So, if you order your 'max-width' queries
// from small to larger, for example for a really small screen like 500px, all the tests
// will be true and the last statement will be executed (tab-land), while you want the
// smallest query to be executed (phone). This result only will occur when you put your
// 'max-width' queries in reverse order (largest screen on top).

// CASE: Mobile-first
// In this case, the order of statements is reversed. Start with lowest screen size
// (phone) and go to the highest (big-desktop).
